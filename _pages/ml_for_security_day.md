## Organized by [CIDRE research team](https://team.inria.fr/cidre/) at CentraleSupelec in Rennes on September 24, 2021

Organizers: [Pierre-François Gimenez](mailto:pierre-francois.gimenez@centralesupelec.fr) and [Yufei Han](mailto:yufei.han@inria.fr)

Machine learning is applied successfully in various domains, including cybersecurity, where it has been used for intrusion detection, malware analysis, and attack comprehension, for example. Therefore, many cybersecurity researchers seek to catch up and introduce such techniques in their research. **The goal of this day is to provide the basics of machine learning for cybersecurity researchers with a practical focus**. No knowledge of machine learning is required!
