I am an associate professor at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) in the [CIDRE](https://team.inria.fr/cidre/) research team since Octobre 2020. I defended my [PhD](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02303275/document) in artificial intelligence at IRIT (in Toulouse, France) in October 2018.

# Interests

I work mainly on intrusion detection, by applying machine learning techniques. Here are a few recent projects:
- Intrusion detection in IoT networks by analyzing the raw radio communication with deep learning. Our solution can monitor wide bands and detect attack in proprietary or undocumented protocols. [PDF](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03123925/document)
- Intrusion detection in a fleet of IoT devices without any model learning, by detecting anomalous devices by its deviation to the rest of the population.
- Intrusion detection and explanation in avionics systems. [PDF](https://hal.laas.fr/hal-03094215/document)

I also work on the security of formal languages and more specifically on injection attacks.

# Teaching

I am teaching various topics at CentraleSupelec, notably:

- Network and security
- Intrusion detection system
- System programming
