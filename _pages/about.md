I am an associate professor at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (Rennes, France) in the [CIDRE](https://team.inria.fr/cidre/) research team since October 2020. I did my [PhD](http://theses.fr/2018TOU30182) in artificial intelligence at IRIT (Toulouse, France) under the supervision of Hélène Fargier and Jérôme Mengin.

# Interests

I have various areas of interest. Most notably:
- applying machine learning techniques to security problems, such as malware analysis, anomaly detection, and data generation
- the application of formal languages theory on system and protocol security, especially on injection-based vulnerabilities

# Collaborations

I am a member of various collaborations:
- "Superviz" PEPR project, a French national program on supervision
- "DefMal" PEPR project, a French national program on malware analysies
- "SecGen" joint team ("Équipe Associée") between Inria and CISPA (Saarbrücken, Germany)

Besides, I regularly work with researchers from DGA (Bruz), Telecom SudParis (Évry), Telecom Paris (Paris), IRIT (Toulouse), LAAS-CNRS (Toulouse), and NICT (Tokyo, Japan)

# Doctoral advisor

I am currently co-supervising three PhD students:
- Maxime Lanvin on unsupervised intrusion detection in networks
- Vincent Raulin on dynamic malware analysis
- Adrien Schoen on network packets generation for IDS evaluation

I was also involved in various PhD:
- [Malcolm Bourdon](http://theses.fr/s261687), defended in 2021
- [Aliénor Damien](http://theses.fr/2020ISAT0001), defended in 2020
- [Jonathan Roux](http://theses.fr/2020TOU30011), defended in 2020

I supervised several M2 research projects:
- [Célia Prat], student at INSA Toulouse, on secure programming languages by design
- [Grégor Quetel], student at University Rennes 1, on intrusion detection based on semantic extraction of parse trees
- [Fanny Dijoud], student at Polytech Nice, on intrusion detection based on heterogeneous dynamic graph

# Teacher

I am teaching various topics at CentraleSupélec, notably:
- Network and security (L3)
- Intrusion detection system (M2)
- System programming (M1 and M2)
