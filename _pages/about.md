I am an associate professor at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (Rennes, France) in the [CIDRE](https://team.inria.fr/cidre/) research team since October 2020. I did my [PhD](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02303275/document) in artificial intelligence at IRIT (Toulouse, France).

# Interests

I mainly work on intrusion detection, where I apply various machine learning techniques. Here are a few recent projects:
- Intrusion detection in IoT networks by analyzing with deep learning the raw radio communication captured with SDR (software-defined radio). Our solution can monitor wide radio bands and detect low-level attack in proprietary and undocumented protocols. [PDF](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03123925/document)
- Intrusion detection in a fleet of IoT devices without any model learning, by detecting anomalous devices by its deviation to the rest of the population (collaboration with EDF). [PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9306726)
- Intrusion detection and explanation in avionics systems based on bigram timing analysis (collaboration with Thalès AVS). [PDF](https://hal.laas.fr/hal-03094215/document)

I also work on the security of formal languages and more specifically on injection attacks.

# Teaching

I am teaching various topics at CentraleSupelec, notably:
- Network and security (L3)
- Intrusion detection system (M2)
- System programming (M1 and M2)

# Doctoral advisor

I am currently supervising three PhD students:
- Maxime Lanvin on unsupervised intrusion detection in networks
- Vincent Raulin on malware analysis
- Adrien Schoen on network packets generation for IDS evaluation

I were also involved in various PhD:
- Malcolm Bourdon (defended in 2021)
- Aliénor Damien (defended in 2020)
- Jonathan Roux (defended in 2020)
