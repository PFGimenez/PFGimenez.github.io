I was the coordinator of this module in 2023-2024.

Classical security approaches are preventive approaches that aim at stopping any violation of the security policy. Those approaches are necessary but not sufficient. Indeed, an attacker can exploit some vulnerability to circumvent preventive mechanisms. Reactive security consists in monitoring information systems to detect any violation of the security policy. The final goal is to react by applying countermeasures, sometimes automatically, to put the system in a clean state . This course presents the different classical approaches that can be used to detect intrusions in IDS (Intrusion Detection System) probes, the correlation of alerts raised by those probes in SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager), and the sharing of Cyber Threat Intelligence. It also presents security monitoring architectures that rely on such components to build a SOC (Security Operationnal Center).

I teach on the following subjects:
- Anomaly-based intrusion detection with machine learning and experimentation with simple models
- Alert correlation (normalization, fusion, verification, analysis)
