This course aims to train the students in general artificial intelligence techniques:
- Representation of problems with state diagrams
- Automatic resolution with search algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative depth-first search, best-first, greedy search and A*)
- Exploration of game tree (minimax algorithm)
- Graph coloration (Welsh and Power algorithm and DSatur)
- Resolution of constraint satisfaction problems (backtrack and forward checking algorithms)

These algorithms are implemented in OCaml by the students.
