This course aims to train the students in general artificial intelligence techniques:
- representation of problems with state diagrams
- automatic resolution with search algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative depth-first search, best-first, greedy search and A*)
- exploration of game tree (minimax algorithm)
- graph coloration (Welsh and Power algorithm and DSatur)
- resolution of constraint satisfaction problem (backtrack and forward checking algorithm)

These algorithms are implemented in OCaml by the students.
