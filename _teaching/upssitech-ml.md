This course aims to train the students in machine learning techniques:
- Overview of various ML techniques. Supervised learning (decision tree learning, k-nn, SVM) and unsupervised learning.
- Experiments with Weka, a data mining tool
- Bayesian reasoning and learning
- Project on reinforcement learning: the students must develop an agent that learns to escape a maze with Q-learning.
