This course aims to train the students in machine learning techniques:
- overview of various ML techniques. Supervised learning from discrete data (decision tree learning) and continuous data (k-nn, SVM) and unsupervised learning.
- experiments with Weka, a data mining tool
- Bayesian reasoning and learning
- Project of reinforcement learning: the students must develop an agent that learns to escape a maze with Q-learning.
