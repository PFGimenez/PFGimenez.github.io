Network traffic datasets are regularly criticized, notably for the lack of realism and diversity in their attack or benign traffic. Generating synthetic network traffic using generative machine learning techniques is a recent area of research that could complement experimental test beds and help assess the efficiency of network security tools such as network intrusion detection systems. This presentation entails some recent work on this subject. [Slides](https://pfgimenez.fr/files/superviz25.pdf)
