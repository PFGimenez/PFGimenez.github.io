We present our work on the recommendation of values in interactive configuration, with no prior knowledge about the user, but given a list of products previously configured and bought by other users (“sale histories”). The basic idea is to recommend, for a given variable at a given step of the configuration process, a value that has been chosen by other users in a similar context, where the context is defined by the variables that have already been decided, and the values that the current user has chosen for these variables. This presentation details how we handle constraints about the configuration and highlights some experimental results. [Slides](https://pfgimenez.github.io/files/aniti.pdf)
