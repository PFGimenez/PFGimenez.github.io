The talk presents recent work on synthetic data generation. This works aims at creating realistic and diverse network and system datasets to better evaluate security solutions, most notably supervision solutions. I will notably present two works on network flow records generation using pattern mining and on packet header generation using probabilistic timed automata generation.
