This talk presents recent work on anomaly detection in network data and anomaly explanation. Our approach represents the network data with a security objects graph analyzed by an autoencoder. We introduce a new statistical explanation technique for reconstruction-based methods and compare it with SHAP. Finally, we use these explanations to analyze the dataset CICIDS2017 and check whether they match the expertâ€™s expectations. [Slides](https://pfgimenez.github.io/files/nict.pdf)
