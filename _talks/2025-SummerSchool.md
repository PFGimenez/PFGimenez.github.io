Researchers have experimented with many AI techniques for detecting network intrusions. This presentation details how curious results led us to a new research direction at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity. This talk will rely on three recent works: 1) how to apply AI to intrusion detection, 2) a new XAI (eXplainable AI) framework dedicated to anomaly detection and 3) a new method for assessing data quality and generating synthetic network data with AI.
