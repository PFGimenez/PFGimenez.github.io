In this talk, I present my research project named FosR ("faussaire"). It aims to create realistic and diverse network and system datasets to better evaluate security solutions, most notably supervision solutions. I will notably present two works on network flow records generation using pattern mining and on packet header generation using probabilistic timed automata generation.
