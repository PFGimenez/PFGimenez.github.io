In this keynote, I present the work that lead us to work on synthetic data generation, and how we generate security data. This works aims at creating realistic and diverse network and system datasets to better evaluate security solutions, most notably supervision solutions. I will notably present two works on network flow records generation using pattern mining and on packet header generation using probabilistic timed automata generation.
