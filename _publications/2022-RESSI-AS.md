title: "Towards generic quality assessment of synthetic traffic for evaluating intrusion detection systems"
collection: publications
excerpt: "Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes) evaluation requires background traffic. However, real background traffic is hard to collect. We hence rely on synthetic traffic generated especially for this task. The quality of the generated traffic has to be evaluated according to some clearly defined criteria. In this paper, we show how to adapt the quality assessment solutions proposed for different fields of data generation such as image or text generation to network traffic. We summarize our study by discussing the criteria that evaluate the quality of a generated network traffic and by proposing functions to evaluate these criteria. This is the first contribution in the context of the Ph.D. thesis of Adrien Schoen."
