title: "Towards a Representation of Malware Execution Traces for Experts and Machine Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-RESSI-VR
excerpt: "Dynamic analysis is a common technique to analyze the run-time behavior of software and identify malware (malicious software). Execution traces typically contain the list of system calls with their parameters, the list of accessed files, etc. Several representations have been proposed to organize these data better and help both human experts and automated tools analyze them effectively. This paper reviews these representations and identifies four research problems that the first author plans to investigate during his Ph.D."
