title: "SuperviZ25-SQL: High-Quality Dataset to Empower Unsupervised SQL Injection Detection Systems"
collection: publications
excerpt: "The digitalization of public and private services led to more sophisticated and serious cybersecurity threats. Among them, SQL injection attacks leverage user inputs to remotely execute malicious actions on a database, such as data exfiltration and deletion, or privilege escalation. They are regularly classified as one of the most prominent threats to web services. Intrusion detection systems are widely used to detect such injection attacks and react to them, but it is difficult to assess their actual effectiveness and compare them because of a lack of high-quality datasets. Current SQL injection datasets lack structural diversity, are poorly documented, and generated samples are not representative of real-world infrastructures. This article presents a new dataset, called S25-SQL, whose design is structured around four quality dimensions: realism, diversity, benchmarking capabilities and the presence of good documentation. Nine novelty-detection baselines leveraging standard feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms are provided, serving as reference points for future SQL injection detection techniques."
