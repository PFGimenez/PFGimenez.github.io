excerpt: "In program analysis, a fuzzing toolset is needed to automatically trigger software operations in a natural while efficient way. Especially in dynamic analysis of malware, such a toolset can help execute the suspicious files to unveil their malicious payloads hidden by other benign-looking behaviors. In the fields of software testing, this tool is necessary for triggering and testing the programmed functionalities. Nevertheless, there has not yet been an easy-to-use tool that works on Windows for the purpose of generating activity through the Graphical User Interface (GUI). To meet this requirement, in our work, we develop GUI-Mimic. It is designed to integrate some useful features for stimulating different types of software -- mouse and keyboard recording, random mouse and keyboard inputs, editing, trimming, randomization, transformations -- to deliver an easy-to-deploy GUI fuzzer over different Operating Systems."
